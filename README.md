# NAPS PM2.5 Data Analysis & Forecasting (2000â€“2025)

This project aims to analyze PM2.5 data from the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program for the period 2000-2023 and develop forecasting models to predict PM2.5 levels for 2024 and 2025.

## Project Objectives

- Download and preprocess NAPS PM2.5 data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- Develop and evaluate time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
- Forecast PM2.5 levels for 2024 and 2025.
- Document the process, findings, and results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository (if applicable).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (see `project_plan.md` for details).
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Follow the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for a step-by-step execution of the analysis.
